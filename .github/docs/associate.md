# CRUK Node.js Recruitment Assignment - Associate level

### Functional Requirements

Build a simple service in Node.js that can be deployed to AWS which exposes an API and can be consumed from any client.

This service should check how many donations a user has made and send them a thank you message (e.g. via SNS) if they make 2 or more donations.

### Output Package Requirements

The solution has to be provided as a Github repository including full commit history.

Please follow the frequent commit practice so that your local repository indicates reasonable milestones of your implementation.

The repository MUST contain:
- Source code
    - It should be buildable/viewable.
    - It must be written in Typescript.
    - In case you need to use external libraries, please add them.

The repository MAY contain:    
- Basic tests.

### Guidelines

If you do not complete the test please indicate how you would intend to finalize it in the README.

The team is looking to see how you approach a problem with a broad spec which could have a number of different solutions and then explaining your approach.
